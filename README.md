# Flash Cards Backend

This is the backend of an app I created to help me with language learning.
It uses ExpressJS for the server and MongoDB as its database management system.
Pexels API is used for providing related pictures for words.
OpenAI API is used for generating example sentences for words.
The app is easy to deploy, having NodeJS installed and running the code "npm install && npm start" should be sufficient.

The source code for the frontend and more information about the app can be found [here](https://github.com/sourcyed/flash-cards).
